Hi There!

Welcome to my blog. I am Anjay Goel. I am a recent graduate from IIT Kharagpur, where I majored in Economics.
I work as a Product Engineer at Dashtoon, a startup leveraging Gen AI to allow people to create comics.
My interests vary from software development and machine learning to economics and finance. Occasionally, I write this blog about stuff that I find interesting & worth sharing.

PS: If you want to contact me, my details are at the bottom of the left sidebar.
